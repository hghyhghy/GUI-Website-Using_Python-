😉 Hey This Is My Small Try and Experiment with  This App

✌️First You need to Visit Anvil.works Website 

     The url is as below 
     👇👇
  https://anvil.works/ 

  <step1> ✌️ You need To visit that url and Log in with your preferred Browser like google ,msEdge  etc

  <step2> ✌️ Then You have to click the👉👉START BUILDING👈👈   button  and choose your favourite template 

⏺️I HAVE CHOOSEN THE BLANK APP TEMPLATE TO CREATE THIS APP⏺️
  
                                 
                                    


  ⏭️⏭️ THEN YOU HAVE TO DESIGN YOUR APP ON THE BASIS OF YOUR CHOICES ⏮️⏮️

  🟡🟡AS FAR AS I HAVE USED  FIRTS YOU NEED TO CREATE A BLANK APP THEN USE THE GIVEN OBJECTS LIKE
                              
1>COLUMN
2>TEXT-BOX
3>LABEL-BOX
4>LINKS
5>DATA-HOLDER
6>BUTTONS
7>CALENDER
8>DROP-DOWN
AND MANY OTHER THINGS
🟡🟡

⏮️⏺️NOW YOU NEED TO WRITE THE PYTHON CODE TO ACCESS THOSE DATA BY CREATING A def FUNCTION ⏺️⏭️

⏮️⏺️THEN YOU NEED TO CREATE A DATABASE WITH THE DATABASE SECTION WHERE YOU CAN SEE THE DATA STORED FROM THE USER WHO GAVE LOGGED IN TO YOUR WEBSITE  ⏺️⏭️

                              


>> THE CODE THAT I HAVE USED IN THAT APP TO ACCESS THE DATA AS BACKEND AS WELL AS FOR A POP UP MESSAGE IS UPLOADED IN 👉👉Anvil👈👈FOLDER

 ♾️ONE OF THE EASILY USABLE APP ON OPEN PLATFORM TO CREATE WEBSIT IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME WITHOUT USING HTML,CSS, JS, BOOTSTRAP, TAILWIND CSS OR ANY OTHER FRAMEWORKS ♾️

  <IT HAS A DEMAND OF ONLY PYTHON KNOWLEDGE >
